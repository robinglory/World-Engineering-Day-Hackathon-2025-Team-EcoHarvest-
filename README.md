# EcoHarvest - WED Hackathon 2025

EcoHarvest is an innovative smart farming solution designed to empower small-scale farmers to adapt to climate change. By integrating mechatronics, web technologies, and sustainable design, we aim to address key agricultural challenges such as water scarcity, pest management, and energy efficiency. This project was developed as part of the **World Engineering Day Hackathon 2025**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

EcoHarvest leverages the latest in engineering and technology to create a scalable, affordable, and sustainable farming solution. Our system includes:

- **Automated Mechatronics System**:
  - A smart irrigation system using soil moisture sensors.
  - Retractable roof design for weather adaptability.
  - Pest deterrent system controlled via a web app.
- **Web Application**:
  - Real-time data visualization for moisture levels, temperature, pest control, and roof states.
  - Weather forecasts (today's and 5-day ahead predictions) to help farmers plan better.
  - Knowledge hub for pest management and crop care.
  - User-friendly interface with light and dark modes.

## üå± How EcoHarvest Contributes to the UN SDGs

Our project addresses several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):
1. **SDG 1: No Poverty** - By making farming more efficient and reducing crop losses, EcoHarvest helps increase farmer incomes.
2. **SDG 2: Zero Hunger** - Supports sustainable agriculture, ensuring food security for small-scale farmers.
3. **SDG 13: Climate Action** - Helps farmers adapt to climate change impacts with weather-resilient tools.
4. **SDG 5: Gender Equality** - Focuses on accessibility for women farmers by providing easy-to-use and affordable technology.
